title: Partial replacement with a badly fitting original code block.
expected_outcome: Should result in ActionResultFailure due to high Levenshtein distance.
code_response_part:
  type: partial
  filepath: simple_func.py
  language: python
  original_code: |
    def calculate_sum(a, b):
        # This is a completely different function signature and body
        return a + b + 100
  new_code: |
    def calculate_product(x, y):
        return x * y
  context_anchor: "def my_function():"
  notes:
    - Attempt to replace a function that doesn't exist with a very different block.
